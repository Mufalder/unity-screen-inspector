# Screen Inspector
Small Unity tool that allows you to see phone screen limitations in the editor.

Imagine you are a mobile developer, but you donâ€™t have a device, and every time you create an interface or place objects, you forget to take into account some screen limitations, for example: round endges or notch. Then this tool is for you. This small utility allows you to see these restrictions in the game window so that you can precisely position the interface or objects on the scene.
